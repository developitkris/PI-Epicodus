#### _Our private island webpage for our client site, 13 March 2018_

#### By _**Kristi Hwang & David Tumpowsky**_

## Description

_This is an initial website created for our client's private island resort.  Our client has requested two versions of stylized designs to compare which would be a better fit for the company.  In accordance, we have created two options for them in color schemes of warm_colors and cool_colors_.  After presenting the two options to the client, they made the decision to go with cool_colors.  After this decision, we merged the then current cool_color scheme into our master version of the website to correctly update the changes.  What you see before you is the current and up to date version of the requested and chosen website by our client._
